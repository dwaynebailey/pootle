# Porting plan: repo & branch strategy

> **Critical rule: no code is ever pushed to `upstream` (`translate/pootle`).**
> This fork is a one-way street — fixes may be pulled *from* upstream (see
> below), nothing is ever pushed *to* it. Locally, `upstream`'s push URL is
> set to a dummy value (`git remote set-url --push upstream
> DISABLED_DO_NOT_PUSH_TO_UPSTREAM`) so an accidental `git push upstream`
> fails immediately instead of reaching the real repo. Anyone re-cloning
> this fork should set that up again before doing any work.

This fork (`dwaynebailey/pootle`) is a personal effort to modernize Pootle
(Python 3, current Django, current dependencies — see the full audit for
detail). These are the Phase 0 / stream J decisions this file exists to
record, so they don't live only in chat history.

## Repo & remotes

- `origin` — `dwaynebailey/pootle`, this fork. `main` is the integration
  branch for the port and is the default branch.
- `upstream` — `translate/pootle`, the original project. Not tracking it as
  a merge target; there is no near-term plan to merge this work back.
- `master` on both remotes is kept as a plain mirror of upstream's `master`
  (fast-forward only) — a reference point, not a working branch.

## Working-branch strategy

- Port work happens on long-lived branches per phase (e.g.
  `python3-port`, `django-ladder`), rebased periodically against this
  fork's `main` — not against upstream. Given the scope (cross-cutting
  framework changes across ~39k lines, single-maintainer effort),
  trunk-based feature flags aren't worth the overhead; a rebased long-lived
  branch per phase is the better fit.
- Each phase branch merges into `main` when its own exit criteria (see the
  audit's roadmap) are met.

## Taking fixes from upstream

- No freeze policy applies to upstream's `master` — it isn't this fork's
  responsibility. Instead: periodically (quarterly, by default) review
  `upstream/master` for genuine bugfixes and security patches and
  cherry-pick or merge them into `main`, so this fork doesn't drift on
  things unrelated to the port.
- Skip anything upstream that's purely stylistic or unrelated to
  correctness/security, to keep the diff against upstream legible.

## Recruitment / merging back

- Deferred. No public plan announcement, no upstream PR, while this stays
  a private, personal fork. Revisit once the port is stable enough to
  show.
